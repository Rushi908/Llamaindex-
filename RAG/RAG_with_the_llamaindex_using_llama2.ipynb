DNNs are powerful because they can per formarbitrary parallel computation\\nfor a modest number of steps. A surprising example of the powe r of DNNs is their ability to sort\\nN N-bit numbersusingonly 2 hiddenlayersofquadraticsize [27 ]. So, while neuralnetworksare\\nrelated to conventional statistical models, they learn an i ntricate computation. Furthermore, large\\nDNNscanbetrainedwithsupervisedbackpropagationwhenev erthelabeledtrainingsethasenough\\ninformationto specify the network’sparameters.

It is a signiﬁcant limitation, since\\nmanyimportantproblemsare best expressed with sequencesw hose lengthsare not knowna-priori.\\nFor example, speech recognitionand machine translation ar e sequential problems.

Our approach is closely relat ed to Kalchbrennerand Blunsom [18]\\nwhoweretheﬁrsttomaptheentireinputsentencetovector,a ndisrelatedtoChoetal.[5]although\\nthe latter was used only for rescoring hypothesesproduced b y a phrase-based system. Graves [10]\\nintroduced a novel differentiable attention mechanism tha t allows neural networks to focus on dif-\\nferent parts of their input, and an elegant variant of this id ea was successfully applied to machine\\ntranslation by Bahdanau et al. [2]. The Connectionist Seque nce Classiﬁcation is another popular\\ntechnique for mapping sequences to sequences with neural ne tworks, but it assumes a monotonic\\nalignmentbetweentheinputsandtheoutputs[11].\\nFigure 1: Our model reads an input sentence “ABC” and produces “WXYZ” a s the output sentence. The\\nmodel stops making predictions after outputting the end-of -sentence token. Note that the LSTM reads the\\ninput sentence inreverse, because doing so introduces many short term dependencies inthe data that make the\\noptimizationproblem much easier.\\nThe main result of this work is the following. On the WMT’14 En glish to French translation task,\\nwe obtained a BLEU score of 34.81by directly extractingtranslationsfrom an ensemble of 5 de ep\\nLSTMs(with384Mparametersand8,000dimensionalstateeac h)usingasimpleleft-to-rightbeam-\\nsearch decoder.

By doingso, we introducedmanyshorttermdependencies that madetheoptimizationproblem\\nmuch simpler (see sec. 2 and 3.3). As a result, SGD could learn LSTMs that had no trouble with\\nlong sentences.

At each timestep we extend each partial hypoth esis in the beam with every possible\\nword in the vocabulary.

By doing so, the LSTM’s test perplexity dropped f rom 5.8 to 4.7, and the test BLEU\\nscoresofitsdecodedtranslationsincreasedfrom25.9to30 .6.\\nWhile we do not have a complete explanation to this phenomeno n, we believe that it is caused by\\nthe introductionof manyshort term dependenciesto the data set. Normally,when we concatenatea\\nsourcesentencewithatargetsentence,eachwordinthesour cesentenceisfarfromitscorresponding\\nword in the target sentence. As a result, the problem has a lar ge “minimal time lag” [17].

In these networks, attention aligns encoder and\\ndecoder states and is often used for visualizing network behavior. However, the\\nmechanisms used by networks to generate appropriate attention matrices are still\\nmysterious. Moreover, how these mechanisms vary depending on the particular\\narchitecture used for the encoder and decoder (recurrent, feed-forward, etc.) are also\\nnot well understood. In this work, we investigate how encoder-decoder networks\\nsolve different sequence-to-sequence tasks. We introduce a way of decomposing\\nhidden states over a sequence into temporal (independent of input) and input-\\ndriven (independent of sequence position) components. This reveals how attention\\nmatrices are formed: depending on the task requirements, networks rely more\\nheavily on either the temporal or input-driven components. These ﬁndings hold\\nacross both recurrent and feed-forward architectures despite their differences in\\nforming the temporal components. Overall, our results provide new insight into the\\ninner workings of attention-based encoder-decoder networks.\\n1 Introduction\\nModern machine learning encoder-decoder architectures can achieve strong performance on sequence-\\nto-sequence tasks such as machine translation (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Luong et al., 2015; Wu et al.,\\n2016; Vaswani et al., 2017), language modeling (Raffel et al., 2020), speech-to-text (Chan et al.,\\n2015; Prabhavalkar et al., 2017; Chiu et al., 2018), etc. Many of these architectures make use of\\nattention (Bahdanau et al., 2014), a mechanism that allows the network to focus on a speciﬁc part of\\nthe input most relevant to the current prediction step. Attention has proven to be a critical mechanism;\\nindeed many modern architectures, such as the Transformer, are fully attention-based (Vaswani et al.,\\n2017). However, despite the success of these architectures, an understanding of how said networks\\nsolve such tasks using attention remains largely unknown.\\nAttention mechanisms are attractive because they are interpretable, and often illuminate key com-\\nputations required for a task. For example, consider neural machine translation—trained networks\\nexhibit attention matrices that align words in the encoder sequence with the appropriate correspond-\\ning position in the decoder sentence (Ghader & Monz, 2017; Ding et al., 2019). In this case, the\\nattention matrix already contains information about which words in the source sequence are relevant\\nfor translating a particular word in the target sequence; that is, forming the attention matrix itself\\n35th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2021).arXiv:2110.15253v1  [cs.LG]  28 Oct 2021', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

How is it that networks are able to achieve\\nthis? What are the mechanisms underlying how networks form attention, and how do they vary across\\ntasks and architectures?\\nIn this work, we study these questions by analyzing three different encoder-decoder architectures on\\nsequence-to-sequence tasks. We develop a method for decomposing the hidden states of the network\\ninto a sum of components that let us isolate input driven behavior from temporal (or sequence) driven\\nbehavior. We use this to ﬁrst understand how networks solve tasks where all samples use the same\\nattention matrix, a diagonal one. We then build on that to show how additional mechanisms can\\ngenerate sample-dependent attention matrices that are still close to the average matrix.\\nOur Contributions\\n•We propose a decomposition of hidden state dynamics into separate pieces, one of which explains\\nthe temporal behavior of the network, another of which describes the input behavior. We show\\nsuch a decomposition aids in understanding the behavior of networks with attention.\\n•In the tasks studied, we show the temporal (input) components play a larger role in determining\\nthe attention matrix as the average attention matrix becomes a better (worse) approximation for a\\nrandom sample’s attention matrix.\\n•We discuss the dynamics of architectures with attention and/or recurrence and show how the\\ninput/temporal component behavior differs across said architectures.\\n•We investigate the detailed temporal and input component dynamics in a synthetic setting to\\nunderstand the mechanism behind common sequence-to-sequence structures and how they might\\ndiffer in the presence of recurrence.\\nRelated Work As mentioned in the introduction, a common technique to gain some understanding\\nis to visualize learned attention matrices, though the degree to which such visualization can explain\\nmodel predictions is disputed Wiegreffe & Pinter (2019); Jain & Wallace (2019); Serrano & Smith\\n(2019). Input saliency Bastings & Filippova (2020) and attribution-propagation Chefer et al. (2020)\\nmethods have also been studied as potential tools for model interpretability.\\nComplementary to these works, our approach builds on a recent line of work analyzing the computa-\\ntional mechanisms learned by RNNs from a dynamical systems perspective. These analyses have iden-\\ntiﬁed simple and interpretable hidden state dynamics underlying RNN operation on text-classiﬁcation\\ntasks such as binary sentiment analysis (Maheswaranathan et al., 2019; Maheswaranathan & Sussillo,\\n2020) and document classiﬁcation (Aitken et al., 2020). Our work extends these ideas into the domain\\nof sequence-to-sequence tasks.\\nNotation LetTandSbe the input and output sequence length of a given sample, respectively.\\nWe denote the encoder and decoder hidden states by hE\\nt∈Rnwitht= 1,...,T . Similarly, we\\ndenote decoder hidden states by hD\\ns∈Rn, withs= 1,...,S . The encoder and decoder hidden state\\ndimensions are always taken to be equal in this work.

Similarly, we deﬁne an encoder input\\ncomponent to be the average of all hE\\nt−µE\\ntfor hidden states that immediately follow a given input\\nword.

The task is to convert a sequence of input words into a corresponding sequence of\\noutput words, where there is a one-to-one translation dictionary, e.g. converting a sequence of letters\\nto their corresponding position in the alphabet, {B,A,C,A,D}→{ 2,1,3,1,4}. We generate the\\ninput phrases to have variable length, but outputs always have equal length to their input (i.e. T=S).\\nWhile a solution to this task is trivial, it is not obvious how each neural network architecture will\\nsolve the task. Although this is a severely simpliﬁed approximation to realistic sequence-to-sequence\\ntasks, we will show below that many of the dynamics the AED and AO networks learn on this task\\nare qualitatively present in more complex tasks.\\nEncoder-Decoder with Attention. After training the AED architecture, we apply the decomposi-\\ntion of (2)to the hidden states. Plotting the temporal components of both the encoder and decoder,\\nthey each form an approximate circle that is traversed as their respective inputs are read in (Fig. 2a).4\\nAdditionally, we ﬁnd the encoder and decoder temporal components are closest to alignment when\\ns=t. We also plot the input components of the encoder and decoder together with the encoder\\ninput-delta components, i.e. χE\\nx+ ∆hE\\nt, and the network’s readout vectors (Fig. 2b).5We see for\\nthe encoder hidden states, the input-delta components are clustered close to their respective input\\ncomponents, meaning for this task the delta components are negligible. Also note the decoder\\ninput-delta components are signiﬁcantly smaller in magnitude than the decoder temporal components.\\nTogether, this means we can approximate the encoder and decoder hidden states as hE\\nt≈µE\\nt+χE\\nx\\nandhD\\ns≈µD\\ns, respectively. Finally, note the readout vector for a given output word aligns with the\\ninput components of its translated input word, e.g. the readout for ‘ 1’ aligns with the input component\\nfor ‘A’ (Fig. 2b).6\\nFor the one-to-one translation task, the network learns an approximately diagonal attention matrix,\\nmeaning the decoder at time sprimarily attends to the encoder’s hidden state at t=s. Additionally, we\\nﬁnd the temporal and input-delta components to be close to orthogonal for all time steps, which allows\\nthe network’s attention mechanism to isolate temporal dependence rather than input dependence.\\nSince we can approximate the hidden states as hE\\nt≈µE\\nt+χE\\nxandhD\\ns≈µD\\ns, and the temporal\\nand input components are orthogonal, the alignment in (3)can be written simply as ast≈µD\\ns·µE\\nt.\\nThis means that the fullattention is completely described by the temporal components and thus\\ninput-independent (this will not necessarily be true for other tasks, as we will see later).\\nWith the above results, we can understand how AED solves the one-to-one translation task. After\\nreading a given input, the encoder hidden state is primarily composed of an input and temporal\\ncomponent that are approximately orthogonal to one another, with the input component aligned with\\nthe readout of the translated input word (Fig. 2b). The decoder hidden states are approximately made\\nup of only a temporal component, whose sole job is to align with the corresponding encoder temporal\\ncomponent. Temporal components of the decoder and encoder are closest to alignment for t=s,\\nso the network primarily attends to the encoder state hE\\nt=s. The alignment between encoder input\\ncomponents and readouts yields maximum logit values for the correct translation.\\nAttention Only. Now we turn to AO architecture, which is identical to AED except with the recurrent\\nconnections cut, and positional encoding added to the inputs. We ﬁnd that AO has qualitatively\\nsimilar temporal components that give rise to diagonal attention (Fig. 2c) and the input components\\nalign with the readouts (Fig. 2d). Thus AO solves the task in a similar manner as AED. The only\\ndifference is that the temporal components, driven by RNN dynamics in AED, are now driven purely\\nby the positional encoding in AO.\\nVanilla Encoder-Decoder. After training the VED architecture, we ﬁnd the encoder and decoder\\nhidden states belonging to the same time step form clusters, and said clusters are closest to those\\ncorresponding to adjacent time steps. This yields temporal components that are close to one another\\n4Here and in plots that follow, we plot the various components using principal component analysis (PCA)\\nprojections simply as a convenient visualization tool. Other than observation that in some cases the temporal/input\\ncomponents live in a low-dimensional subspace, none of our quantitative analysis is dependent upon the PCA\\nprojections. For all one-to-one plots, a large percentage ( >90%) of the variance is explained by the ﬁrst 2 or 3\\nPC dimensions.\\n5ForNpossible input words, the encoder input components align with the vetrices of an (N−1)-simplex,\\nwhich is similar to the classiﬁcation behavior observed in Aitken et al. (2020).\\n6Since in AED we pass both the decoder hidden state and the context vector to the readout, each readout\\nvector is twice the hidden state dimension.

Additional details of the VED architecture dynamics are\\ndiscussed in Appendix B.6.\\nAdditional Tasks. In this section, we brieﬂy address how two additional synthetic tasks can be\\nunderstood using the temporal and input component decomposition. First, consider a task identical to\\nthe one-to-one task, with the target sequence reversed in time, e.g. {B,A,C,A,D}→{ 4,1,3,1,2}.\\nFor this task, we expect an attention matrix that is anti-diagonal (i.e. it is nonzero for t=S+ 1−s).\\nFor the AED and AO networks trained on this task, we ﬁnd their temporal and input component\\nbehavior to be identical to the original one-to-one task with one exception: instead of the encoder and\\ndecoder temporal components following one another, we ﬁnd one trajectory is ﬂipped in such a way\\nas to yield an anti-diagonal attention matrix (Fig. 2g). That is, the last encoder temporal component\\nis aligned with the ﬁrst decoder temporal component and vice versa.\\nSecond, consider the task of sorting the input alphabetically, e.g. {B,C,A,D}→{ A,B,C,D}.\\nFor this example, we expect the network to learn an input-dependent attention matrix that correctly\\npermutes the input sequence. Since there is no longer a correlation between input and output sequence\\nlocation, the average attention matrix is very different from that of a random sample, and so we expect\\nthe temporal components to insigniﬁcantly contribute to the alignment. Indeed, we ﬁnd µD\\ns·µE\\ntto be\\nnegligible, and instead ∆hD\\ns·χE\\nxdominates the alignment values (Fig. 2h).\\n4 Beyond One-to-One Results\\nIn this section we analyze the dynamics of two tasks that have “close-to-diagonal” attention: (1)\\nwhat we refer to as the extended SCAN dataset and (2) translation between English and French\\nphrases. Since we found temporal/input component decomposition to provide little insight into VED\\ndynamics, our focus in this section will be on only the AED and AO architectures.

The eSCAN tasks is close to one-to-one translation, but is augmented\\nwith several additional rules that modify its structure. For example, a common sequence-to-sequence\\nstructure is that a pair of outputs can swap order relative to their corresponding inputs: the English\\nwords ‘green ﬁeld’ translate to ‘champ vert’ in French (with ‘ﬁeld’ ↔‘champ’ and ‘green’ ↔‘vert’).\\nThis behavior is present in eSCAN: when the input word ‘left’ follows a verb the output command\\nmust ﬁrst turn the respective direction and then perform said action (e.g. ‘run left’ →‘LTURN\\nRUN’).\\nThe AED and AO models both achieve ≥98% word accuracy on eSCAN. Looking at a sample\\nattention matrix of AED, we see consecutive words in the output phrase tend to attend to the same\\nencoder hidden states at the end of subphrases in the input phrase (Fig. 3a). Once again decomposing\\nthe AED network’s hidden states as in (2), we ﬁnd the temporal components of the encoder and\\ndecoder form curves that mirror one another, leading to an approximately diagonal attention matrix\\n(Fig. 3b). The delta components are signiﬁcantly less negligible for this task, as evidence by the fact\\nχE\\nx+ ∆hE\\ntaren’t nearly as clustered around their corresponding input component (Fig. 3c). As we\\nwill verify later, this is a direct result of the network’s use of recurrence, since now hidden states\\ncarry information about subphrases, rather than just individual words.\\nTraining the AO architecture on eSCAN, we also observe non-diagonal attention matrices, but in\\ngeneral their qualitative features differ from those of the AED architecture (Fig. 3d). Focusing on\\nthe subphrase mapping ‘run twice’ →‘RUN RUN’, we see the network learns to attend to the word\\npreceding ‘twice’, since it can no longer rely on recurrence to carry said word’s identity forward.\\nOnce again, the temporal components of the encoder and decoder trace out paths that roughly follow\\none another (Fig. 3e). We see input-delta components cluster around their corresponding input\\ncomponents, indicating the delta components are small (Fig. 3f). Finally, we again see the readouts\\nof particular outputs align well with the input components of their corresponding input word.\\nEnglish to French Translation is another example of a nearly-diagonal task. We train the AED\\nand AO architectures on this natural language task using a subset of the para_crawl dataset Bañón\\net al. (2020) consisting of over 30 million parallel sentences. To aid interpetation, we tokenize each\\nsentence at the word level and maintain a vocabulary of 30k words in each language; we train on\\nsentences of length up to 15 tokens.\\nSince English and French are syntactically similar with roughly consistent word ordering, the attention\\nmatrices are in general close to diagonal (Fig. 4a). Again, note the presence of features that require\\noff-diagonal attention, such as the ﬂipping of word ordering in the input/output phrases and multiple\\nwords in French mapping to a single English word. Using the decomposition of (2), the temporal\\ncomponents in both AED and AO continue to trace out similar curves (Fig. 4b). Notably, the\\nalignment resulting from the temporal components is signiﬁcantly less diagonal, with the diagonal\\nbehavior clearest at the beginning of the phrase. Such behavior makes sense: the presence of off-\\ndiagonal structure means, on average, translation pairs become increasingly offset the further one\\n7', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

In this section, we investigate a few of their features in detail.\\nAlignment Approximation.

Since χE\\nxand∆hE\\ntare dependent upon the input sequence, this means the alignment has\\nnon-trivial input dependence, as we would expect. In both architectures, we ﬁnd this approximation\\ncaptures>87% of the top alignment scores. For translation, we see the term µD\\ns·µE\\ntmakes up a\\nsigniﬁcantly smaller portion of the alignment scores, and in general we ﬁnd none of the nine terms in\\n(3)dominate above the rest (Fig. 5a). However, at early times in the AED architecture, we again see\\nµD\\ns·µE\\ntis the largest contribution to the alignment. As mentioned above, this matches our intuition\\nthat words at the start of the encoder/decoder phrase have a smaller offset from one another than later\\nin the phrase, so the network can rely more on temporal components to determine attention.\\nTemporal Component Offset. For the one-to-one task, the input sequence length was always equal\\nto the output sequence length, so the temporal components were always peaked at s=t(Fig. 5b). In\\neSCAN, the input word ‘and’ has no corresponding output, which has a non-trivial effect on how\\nthe network attends since its appearance means later words in input phrase are offset from their\\ncorresponding output word. This effect also compounds with multiple occurrences of ‘and’ in the\\ninput. The AED and AO networks learn to handle such behavior by biasing the temporal component\\ndot product, µD\\ns·µE\\nt, the dominant alignment contribution, to be larger for time steps tfurther along\\nin the encoder phrase, i.e. t>s (Fig. 5b). It is possible to compute the average offset of input and\\noutput words in eSCAN training set, and we see the maximum of µD\\ns·µE\\ntfollow this estimate quite\\nwell. Similarly, in our set of English to French translation phrases, we ﬁnd the French phrases to be\\non average∼20% longer than their English counterparts. This results in the maximum of µD\\ns·µE\\nt\\nto gradually move toward t<s , e.g. on average the decoder attends to earlier times in the encoder\\n(Fig. 5b). Additionally, note the temporal dot product falls off signiﬁcantly slower as a function of\\noffset for later time steps, indicating the drop off for non-diagonal alignments is smaller and thus it is\\neasier for the network to off-diagonally attend.\\n8', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The encoder hidden states in the one-to-one task had a negligible delta component,\\nso the hidden states could be approximated as hE\\nt≈µE\\nt+χE\\nx. By deﬁnition, χE\\nxis constant for a\\ngiven input word, so the variance in the hidden states corresponding to a given input word is primarily\\ncontained in the temporal component (Fig. 5c). Since the temporal component is input-independent,\\nthis led to a clear understanding of how all of a network’s hidden states evolve with time and input.\\nIn the AED and AO architectures trained on eSCAN, we ﬁnd the variance of the input word’s hidden\\nstates drops by 90% and95% when the temporal component is subtracted out, respectively (Fig. 5c).\\nMeanwhile, in translation, we ﬁnd the variance only drops by 8%and25% for the AED and AO\\narchitectures, indicating there is signiﬁcant variance in the hidden states beyond the average temporal\\nevolution and thus more intricate dynamics.\\nInput/Readout Alignment. Lastly, recall we saw that in the one-to-one case the input components’\\nalignment with readouts implemented the translation dictionary (Figs. 2b, d). For eSCAN, the dot\\nproduct of a given readout is again largest with the input component of its corresponding input word,\\ne.g. the readout corresponding to ‘RUN’ is maximal for the input component of ‘run’ (Fig. 5d).\\nNotably, words that produce no corresponding output such as ‘and’ and ‘twice’ are not the maximal\\nin alignment with any readout vector. Similarly, for translation, we see the French-word readouts\\nhave the largest dot product their translated English words (Fig. 4c). For example, the readouts for\\nthe words ‘la’, ‘le’, and ‘les’, which are the gendered French equivalents of ‘the’, all have maximal\\nalignments with χE\\nthe.\\n4.2 A Closer Look at Dynamics\\nIn this section, we leverage the temporal and input component decomposition to take a closer look at\\nhow networks trained on the eSCAN dataset implement particular off-diagonal attentions. Many of\\nthe sequence translation structures in eSCAN are seen in realistic datasets, so we this analysis will\\ngive clues toward understanding the behavior of more complicated sequence-to-sequence tasks.\\nA common structure in sequence-to-sequence tasks is when an output word is modiﬁed by the words\\npreceding it. For example, the phrases ‘we run‘ and ‘they run’ translate to ‘nous courrons’ and ‘ils\\ncourent’ in French, respectively (with the second word in each the translation of ‘run’). We can study\\nthis phenomenon in eSCAN since the word ‘twice’ tells the network to repeat the command just\\nissued two times, e.g. ‘run twice’ outputs to ‘RUN RUN’. Hence, the output corresponding to the\\ninput ‘twice’ changes based on other words in the phrase.\\nSince an AED network has recurrence, when it sees the word ‘twice’ it can know what verb preceded\\nit. Plotting input-delta components, we see the RNN outputs ‘twice’ hidden states in three separate\\nclusters separated by the preceding word (Fig. 6a). Thus for an occurrence of ‘twice’ at time step t,\\nwe have χE\\ntwice+ ∆hE\\nt≈χE\\nverb+ ∆hE\\nt−1. For example, this means the AED learns to read in ‘run\\ntwice’ approximately the same as ‘run run’.

Hence, unlike the\\nAED case, all occurrences of ‘twice’ are the same input-delta component cluster regardless of what\\nword preceded it. Instead, it has to rely on attending to the word that modiﬁes the output, which in\\nthis case is simply the preceding word (Fig. 3d). As mentioned in Sec. 4.1, for the eSCAN task we\\nﬁnd the alignment to be well approximated by ast≈µD\\ns·hE\\nt. When the word ’twice’ appears in the\\ninput phrase, we ﬁnd µD\\ns·χE\\ntwice+µD\\ns·∆hE\\nt<0fors=t(Fig. 6b). This decreases the value of\\nthe alignment as,s, and so the decoder instead attends to the time step with the second largest value\\nofµD\\ns·µE\\nt, which the network has learned to be t=s−1. Hence,as,s−1is the largest alignment,\\ncorresponding to the time step before ‘twice’ with the verb the network needs to output again. Unlike\\nthe one-to-one case, the encoder input-delta and the decoder temporal components are no longer\\napproximately orthogonal to one another (Fig. 6c). In the case of ‘twice’, χE\\ntwice+ ∆hE\\ntis partially\\nantialigned with the temporal component, yielding a negative dot product.\\nThis mechanism generalizes beyond the word ’twice’: in eSCAN we see input-delta components of\\nseveral input words are no longer orthogonal to the decoder’s temporal component (Fig. 6c). Like\\n‘twice’, the dot product of the input-delta component for a given word with its corresponding temporal\\ncomponent determines how much its alignment score is increased/decreased. For example, we see\\nχE\\nand+ ∆hE\\nthas a negative dot product with the temporal component, meaning it leans away from its\\ncorresponding temporal component. Again, this make sense from eSCAN task: the word ‘and’ has\\nno corresponding output, hence it never wants to be attended to by the decoder.\\nPerhaps contradictory to expectation, χE\\nleft+ ∆hE\\nthas a negative dot product with the temporal\\ncomponent. However, note that the alignment of χE\\nx+ ∆hE\\ntwith the hD\\nsis dependent on both tands.\\nWe plot the dot products of χE\\nx+ ∆hE\\ntandhD\\nsas a function of their offset, deﬁned to be the t−s\\n(Fig. 6d). Notably, χE\\nleft+ ∆hE\\nthas a larger dot product for larger offsets, meaning it increases its\\nalignment when t>s . This makes sense from the point of view that the word ‘left’ is always further\\nalong in the input phrase than its corresponding output ‘LTURN’, and this offset is only compounded\\nby the presence of the word ‘and’. Thus, the word ‘left’ only wants to get noticed if it is ahead of the\\ncorresponding decoder time step, otherwise it hides. Additionally, the words ‘and‘ and ‘twice‘ have\\nlarge negative dot products for all offsets, since they never want to be the subject of attention.\\n5 Discussion\\nIn this work, we studied the hidden state dynamics of sequence-to-sequence tasks in architectures\\nwith recurrence and attention. We proposed a decomposition of the hidden states into parts that\\nare input- and time-independent and showed when such a decomposition aids in understanding the\\nbehavior of encoder-decoder networks.\\nAlthough we have started by analyzing translation tasks, it would be interesting to understand how said\\ndecomposition works on different sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as speech-to-text. Additionally,\\nwith our focus on the simplest encoder-decoder architectures, it is important to investigate how\\nmuch the observed dynamics generalize to more complicated network setups, such as networks with\\nbidirectional RNNs or multiheaded and self-attention mechanisms. Our analysis of the attention-\\nonly architecture, which bears resemblance to the transformer architecture, suggests that a similar\\ndynamical behavior may also hold for the Transformer, hinting at the working mechanisms behind\\nthis popular non-recurrent architecture.\\nAcknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\\nWe thank Ankush Garg for collaboration during the early part of this work.

Since this eliminates any sense of temporal ordering in the\\nsequences, we also add ﬁxed positional encoding vectors (Vaswani et al., 2017), pE\\ntandpD\\nsto the\\nencoder and decoder inputs.

This architecture is meant to be a simpliﬁed model of a Transformer (Vaswani et al.,\\n2017). The hidden states output by the RNN simultaneous ﬁll the role of the usual keys, queries, and\\nvalues of a Transformer.

With the above deﬁnitions, we can decompose encoder and\\ndecoder hidden states resulting from the αth sample as\\nhE\\nt,α=µE\\nt+χE(\\nxE\\nt,α)\\n+ ∆hE\\nt,α, (12a)\\nhD\\ns,α=µD\\ns+χD(\\nxD\\ns,α)\\n+ ∆hD\\ns,α, (12b)\\nwith the delta components deﬁned to be whatever is leftover in the hidden state after subtracting out\\nthe temporal and input components,\\n∆hE\\nt,α:=hE\\nt,α−µE\\nt−χE(\\nxE\\nt,α)\\n, (13a)\\n∆hD\\ns,α:=hD\\ns,α−µD\\ns−χD(\\nxD\\ns,α)\\n. (13b)\\nIn the main text we use the shorthand χE\\nx=χE(\\nxE\\nt,α)\\nandχD\\ny=χD(\\nxD\\ns,α)\\n(since for the decoder,\\nthe previous time step’s output, ys−1is passed as the next input). We will often suppress the batch\\nindex, so altogether the decomposition is written in the main text as\\nhE\\nt=µE\\nt+χE\\nx+ ∆hE\\nt, (14a)\\nhD\\ns=µD\\ns+χD\\ny+ ∆hD\\ns. (14b)\\nThe intuition behind this decomposition is that it is an attempt to isolate the temporal and input\\nbehavior of the network’s hidden state updates FEandFD. This partially motivated by the fact that, if\\nFEwere linear, then the encoder hidden state update for AO could be written as\\nhE\\nt=FE(0,xE\\nt+pE\\nt) =FE(0,xE\\nt) +FE(0,pE\\nt). (15)\\nNotably, the ﬁrst term is only dependent upon the input and the second term is only dependent upon\\nthe sequence index (through the positional encoding). In this case, the temporal and input component\\nwould exactly capture the time and input dependence of the hidden states, respectively. Of course, FE\\nis not in general linear, but we still ﬁnd such a decomposition useful for interpretation.\\nAlignment Using the above decomposition, we can write the alignment as a sum of nine terms:\\nast=(\\nµD\\ns+χD\\ny+ ∆hD\\ns)\\n·(\\nµE\\nt+χE\\nx+ ∆hE\\nt)\\n=µD\\ns·µE\\nt+µD\\ns·χE\\nx+µD\\ns·∆hE\\nt\\n+χD\\ny·µE\\nt+χD\\ny·χE\\nx+χD\\ny·∆hE\\nt\\n+ ∆hD\\ns·µE\\nt+ ∆hD\\ns·χE\\nx+ ∆hD\\ns·∆hE\\nt (16a)\\n:=9∑\\nI=1a(I)\\nst, (16b)\\n14', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

At each time step, a word from a\\nword bank of size Nis randomly chosen (uniformly), and as such there is no correlation between\\nwords at different time steps. The length of a given input phrase is predetermined and also drawn a\\nuniform distribution. After an input phrase is generated, the corresponding output phrase is created by\\nindividually translating each word. All input words translate to a unique output word and translations\\nare solely dependent upon the input word. An example one-to-one dataset would be converting a\\nsequence of letters to their corresponding position in the alphabet, {B,A,C,A,A}→{ 2,1,3,1,1}.\\nNote the task of simply repeating the input phrase as the output is also one-to-one.\\nDue to the small vocabulary size, one-hot encoding is used for input phrases. Train and test sets are\\ngenerated dynamically.\\nExtended SCAN Extended SCAN (eSCAN) is a modiﬁed version of the SCAN dataset Lake &\\nBaroni (2018). The SCAN dataset is a sequence-to-sequence task consisting of translating simple\\ninput commands into output actions. SCAN consists of roughly 20,000 phrases, with a maximum\\ninput and output phrase lengths of 9 and 49, respectively. A few relevant example phrases of eSCAN\\nare shown in Table 1.\\nThe eSCAN dataset modiﬁes SCAN in two ways:\\n1.It takes only a subset of SCAN in which input phrases solely consist of a chosen subset\\nof SCAN words. This allows us to isolate particular behaviors present in SCAN as well\\nas eliminate certain word combinations that would require far-from diagonal attention\\nmechanisms (e.g. it allows us to avoid the input subphrase ‘run around thrice’ that yields an\\noutput subphrase of length 24).\\n2.After a subset of SCAN phrases has been chosen, phrases are randomly drawn (uniformly)\\nand concatenated together until a phrase of the desired length range is created. Individual\\nSCAN phrases are separated by a special word token (a period). This allows us to generate\\nphrases that are much longer than the phrases encountered in the SCAN dataset and also\\ncontrol the variance of phrase lengths.\\nThe eSCAN dataset allows us to gradually increase a phrase’s complexity while having control over\\nphrase lengths. At its simplest, eSCAN can also be one-to-one if one restricts to input phrases with\\nsome combination of the words ‘run’, ‘walk’, ‘jump’, and ‘look’.\\nThroughout the main text, we use the subset of SCAN that contains the words ‘run’, ‘walk’, ‘jump’,\\n‘and’, ‘left’, and ‘twice’ with lengths ranging from 10 to 15. Furthermore, we omit combinations that\\n15', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

For the AO\\narchitecture, the input dimension was padded up 50and100for the one-to-one and eSCAN tasks,\\nrespectively. Positional encoding vectors were rotated by a random orthonormal matrix so they\\nwere misaligned with the one-hot-encoded input vectors. Finally, we found performance improved\\nwhen positional encoding time-scale τwas chosen to be of order the phrase length: τ= 50 for the\\none-to-one tasks and τ= 100 for the eSCAN tasks.\\nFor the natural translation datasets, each token was mapped to an embedded vector of dimension\\n128 using a learned embedding layer. Both the AED and AO architectures used GRU cells, with\\nhidden dimension size of n= 128 . As in the synthetic datasets, we train using the ADAM optimizer\\nfor 30,000 steps using a batch size of 64; we use an exponential learning rate schedule with initial\\nη= 0.01and a decay rate of 0.99995. Gradients are clipped to a maximum value of 30.\\nB Additional Results\\nIn this section, we discuss several additional results that supplement those discussed in the main text.\\nB.1 LSTM and UGRNN Cells\\nIn the main text, all plots used a GRU RNN for the cells in the encoder and decoder. For the UGRNN\\nand LSTM we ﬁnd qualitatively similar results on the one-to-one task. Summaries of our results for\\nthe two RNN cells are shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9, respectively. For all types of cells, the networks\\nachieve 100% test accuracy on the one-to-one task.\\nNotably, for the AED architecture, we observe that the LSTM has a slightly different attention matrix\\nthan that of the GRU and UGRNN. Namely, for the ﬁrst few decoder time steps, the LSTM appears\\nto attend to hE\\nTof a given phrase. This means that the network is transferring information about\\nthe ﬁrst few inputs all the way to the ﬁnal encoder hidden state. As such, it appears that the AED\\narchitecture with LSTM cells relies more on recurrence to solve the one-to-one task relative to its\\nGRU and UGRNN counterparts. Similar to our ﬁndings for the VED architecture in the main text,\\nwe ﬁnd the input-delta components to be signiﬁcantly less clustered around their corresponding\\ninput components when this occurs (Fig. 9b). In contrast, the AO architecture with LSTM cells is\\nqualitatively similar to that with the GRU or UGRNN cells.\\nWe also train the AO architecture with LSTM and UGRNN cells on eSCAN. We again see qualitatively\\nsimilar behavior to what we saw in the main text for AO with GRU cells (Fig. 10). For both types\\nof cells, we see the temporal components align to form an approximately diagonal attention matrix\\n(Fig. 10b,e). Once again, we see the input-delta components to be closely clustered around their\\ncorresponding input components, and said input components are close to their respective readouts,\\nimplementing the translation dictionary (Fig. 10c,f).\\n17', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

In the case of AED and VED, this means the\\nencoder RNNs are driven solely by their recurrent behavior. For AO, the encoder RNNs are driven by\\nonly the positional encoding vectors. Since in all three cases this results network outputting hidden\\nstates independent of the details of the input, we call this the autonomous dynamics of the network.\\nDenote the encoder and decoder hidden states resulting from no input by hE,0\\ntandhD,0\\ns, respectively.\\nFor AED and VED, they are\\nhE,0\\nt=FE(hE,0\\nt−1,0), hD,0\\ns=FD(hD,0\\ns−1,0). (21)\\nFor the AO network, we still add the positional encoding vectors to the inputs,\\nhE,0\\nt=FE(0,pE\\nt), hD,0\\ns=FD(0,pD\\ns). (22)\\nPlotting the resulting hidden states along with the temporal components, we ﬁnd for all three\\narchitectures the two quantities are quite close at all time steps of the encoder and decoder (Fig. 11).\\nWe quantify the degree to which the null hidden states approximate the temporal components via\\n∥hE\\nt−hE,0\\nt∥2/∥hE\\nt∥2and∥hD\\ns−hD,0\\ns∥2/∥hD\\ns∥2where∥·∥2denotes theℓ2-norm. For the AO network,\\nwe ﬁnd the average of this quantity across the entire encoder and decoder phrases to be about 0.07\\nand0.08, respectively, while for AED we ﬁnd it to be 0.07for the encoder and 0.19for the decoder.\\nWe also ﬁnd the null hidden states to be close to the temporal components of eSCAN (Fig. 12). Again,\\naveraging our difference measure across the entire encoder and decoder phrases, for AO we ﬁnd 0.11\\nand0.15and for AED 0.21and0.17, respectively.\\nThis result gives insight into the network dynamics that drive the behavior of the temporal components.\\nIn AED and VED, each RNN cell is driven by two factors: the recurrent hidden state and the input.\\nThe AO architecture is similar, but the recurrence is replaced by temporal information through the\\npositional encoding. The absence of input eliminates the input-driven behavior in the RNN cells.\\nSince the network’s hidden states still trace out paths very close to the temporal components, this is\\nevidence that it is the recurrent dynamics (in the case of AED and VED) or the positional encoding\\nvectors that drive the network’s temporal component behavior.\\nOne can use this information to postulate other behaviors in the network. For instance, given the lack\\nof correlation between inputs in the one-to-one translation task, in the AO network one may wonder\\nhow much of the decoder’s dynamics are driven by recurrent versus input behavior. We already know\\nthe decoder’s primary job in this network is to align its temporal components with that of the encoder,\\nand the results above suggest said behavior is driven primarily by the positional encoding vectors and\\nnot the inputs. To test this, we compare the accuracies of a trained network with and without inputs\\ninto the decoder RNN. We still achieve 100% word accuracy when xD\\ns=0for all decoder time steps.\\nB.3 Learned Attention\\nIn addition to the dot-product attention considered throughout the main text, we have implemented\\nand analyzed new architectures that are identical to the AED and AO architectures that use a learned-\\nattention mechanism.

As such, each output’s readout can be viewed as twovectors\\nin hidden state space: one which acts on the context vector and the other which acts on the decoder\\nhidden state output. Here we elaborate on our comment in the main text regarding the effects of the\\ndecoder readouts being negligible.\\nRecall that after training the AED network, we found the context vector readouts align with the\\nencoder input components, yielding the translation dictionary for a given task. We ﬁnd the the decoder\\nreadouts to be close to orthogonal to the context vector readouts (Fig. 15). Furthermore, we ﬁnd the\\nreadouts for all words other than the ‘eos’ character to be closely aligned. Omitting the ‘eos‘ effect,\\nthis results in the decoder readouts contributing roughly equal values to all logit values. Since the\\nlogit values are passed through a softmax function, it is their differences that ultimately matter when\\nit comes to classifying a given output as a word. In contrast, we found the context vector readouts to\\nalign with the vertices of an (N−1)-simplex and the logit value contributions to vary signiﬁcantly\\nmore with the hidden state. Indeed, comparing the difference between the largest and second largest\\nlogit contribution of each set of readouts, we ﬁnd the difference due to the context vector readouts to\\nbe several times larger than that of the decoder readouts. For AED trained on eSCAN, we again ﬁnd\\nthe differences in the context vector logit contributions to be several times larger than that due to the\\ndecoder hidden states.\\nB.6 Vanilla Encoder-Decoder Dynamics\\nIn the main text, we brieﬂy discussed the dynamics of the VED architecture, and here we provide\\nsome additional details. After training the VED architecture on the one-to-one translation task, we\\nfound that the encoder and decoder hidden states belonging to the same time step formed clusters,\\nand said clusters are closest to those corresponding to adjacent time steps. Additionally, since the\\nVED arhcitecture has no attention, the encoder and decoder hidden states have to carry all relevant\\ninformation from preceding steps. To facilitate this, the dynamics of the encoder’s hidden state space\\norganizes itself into a tree structure to encode the input phrases (Fig. 16). Starting from the encoder’s\\ninitial hidden state, the hidden states of a given input phrase traverse the branches of said tree as the\\nphrase is read in, ultimately arriving at one of the tree’s leaves at time T. The distinct leaves represent\\nthe different ﬁnal encoder hidden states, hE\\nT, that must encode the input phrase’s words and their\\nordering.\\nSince the decoder receives no additional input, the encoder must place hE\\nTin a location of hidden\\nstate space for the decoder’s dynamics to produce the entire output phrase.

Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [ 21] and conditional\\ncomputation [ 32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [ 2,19]. In all but a few cases [ 27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [ 18] and ConvS2S [ 9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [ 5,2,35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., x n)to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z= (z1, ..., z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., y m)of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [ 11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm( x+ Sublayer( x)), where Sublayer( x)is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512 .\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N= 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions.

The keys and values are also packed together into matrices KandV. We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention( Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [ 2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof1√dk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dkthe two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk[3].

Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n•In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n•The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n•Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN( x) = max(0 , xW 1+b1)W2+b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff= 2048 .\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [ 30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by√dmodel.\\n5', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nPE(pos,2i)=sin(pos/100002i/d model)\\nPE(pos,2i+1)=cos(pos/100002i/d model)\\nwhere posis the position and iis the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2πto10000 ·2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k,PEpos+kcan be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [ 9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., x n)to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., z n), with xi, zi∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [ 12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n)sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n6', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k)convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\norO(logk(n))in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k·n·d+n·d2). Even with k=n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [ 38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [ 20] with β1= 0.9,β2= 0.98andϵ= 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate =d−0.5\\nmodel·min(step_num−0.5, step _num·warmup _steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup _steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup _steps = 4000 .\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Unlike recent language repre-\\nsentation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Rad-\\nford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-\\ntrain deep bidirectional representations from\\nunlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both\\nleft and right context in all layers. As a re-\\nsult, the pre-trained BERT model can be ﬁne-\\ntuned with just one additional output layer\\nto create state-of-the-art models for a wide\\nrange of tasks, such as question answering and\\nlanguage inference, without substantial task-\\nspeciﬁc architecture modiﬁcations.\\nBERT is conceptually simple and empirically\\npowerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art re-\\nsults on eleven natural language processing\\ntasks, including pushing the GLUE score to\\n80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement),\\nMultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute\\nimprovement), SQuAD v1.1 question answer-\\ning Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute im-\\nprovement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1\\n(5.1 point absolute improvement).\\n1 Introduction\\nLanguage model pre-training has been shown to\\nbe effective for improving many natural language\\nprocessing tasks (Dai and Le, 2015; Peters et al.,\\n2018a; Radford et al., 2018; Howard and Ruder,\\n2018). These include sentence-level tasks such as\\nnatural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015;\\nWilliams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan\\nand Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the re-\\nlationships between sentences by analyzing them\\nholistically, as well as token-level tasks such as\\nnamed entity recognition and question answering,\\nwhere models are required to produce ﬁne-grained\\noutput at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and\\nDe Meulder, 2003; Rajpurkar et al., 2016).There are two existing strategies for apply-\\ning pre-trained language representations to down-\\nstream tasks: feature-based andﬁne-tuning . The\\nfeature-based approach, such as ELMo (Peters\\net al., 2018a), uses task-speciﬁc architectures that\\ninclude the pre-trained representations as addi-\\ntional features. The ﬁne-tuning approach, such as\\nthe Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI\\nGPT) (Radford et al., 2018), introduces minimal\\ntask-speciﬁc parameters, and is trained on the\\ndownstream tasks by simply ﬁne-tuning allpre-\\ntrained parameters. The two approaches share the\\nsame objective function during pre-training, where\\nthey use unidirectional language models to learn\\ngeneral language representations.\\nWe argue that current techniques restrict the\\npower of the pre-trained representations, espe-\\ncially for the ﬁne-tuning approaches. The ma-\\njor limitation is that standard language models are\\nunidirectional, and this limits the choice of archi-\\ntectures that can be used during pre-training. For\\nexample, in OpenAI GPT, the authors use a left-to-\\nright architecture, where every token can only at-\\ntend to previous tokens in the self-attention layers\\nof the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). Such re-\\nstrictions are sub-optimal for sentence-level tasks,\\nand could be very harmful when applying ﬁne-\\ntuning based approaches to token-level tasks such\\nas question answering, where it is crucial to incor-\\nporate context from both directions.\\nIn this paper, we improve the ﬁne-tuning based\\napproaches by proposing BERT: Bidirectional\\nEncoder Representations from Transformers.\\nBERT alleviates the previously mentioned unidi-\\nrectionality constraint by using a “masked lan-\\nguage model” (MLM) pre-training objective, in-\\nspired by the Cloze task (Taylor, 1953). The\\nmasked language model randomly masks some of\\nthe tokens from the input, and the objective is to\\npredict the original vocabulary id of the maskedarXiv:1810.04805v2  [cs.CL]  24 May 2019', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Unlike left-to-\\nright language model pre-training, the MLM ob-\\njective enables the representation to fuse the left\\nand the right context, which allows us to pre-\\ntrain a deep bidirectional Transformer. In addi-\\ntion to the masked language model, we also use\\na “next sentence prediction” task that jointly pre-\\ntrains text-pair representations. The contributions\\nof our paper are as follows:\\n• We demonstrate the importance of bidirectional\\npre-training for language representations. Un-\\nlike Radford et al. (2018), which uses unidirec-\\ntional language models for pre-training, BERT\\nuses masked language models to enable pre-\\ntrained deep bidirectional representations. This\\nis also in contrast to Peters et al. (2018a), which\\nuses a shallow concatenation of independently\\ntrained left-to-right and right-to-left LMs.\\n• We show that pre-trained representations reduce\\nthe need for many heavily-engineered task-\\nspeciﬁc architectures. BERT is the ﬁrst ﬁne-\\ntuning based representation model that achieves\\nstate-of-the-art performance on a large suite\\nof sentence-level andtoken-level tasks, outper-\\nforming many task-speciﬁc architectures.\\n• BERT advances the state of the art for eleven\\nNLP tasks. The code and pre-trained mod-\\nels are available at https://github.com/\\ngoogle-research/bert .\\n2 Related Work\\nThere is a long history of pre-training general lan-\\nguage representations, and we brieﬂy review the\\nmost widely-used approaches in this section.\\n2.1 Unsupervised Feature-based Approaches\\nLearning widely applicable representations of\\nwords has been an active area of research for\\ndecades, including non-neural (Brown et al., 1992;\\nAndo and Zhang, 2005; Blitzer et al., 2006) and\\nneural (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al.,\\n2014) methods. Pre-trained word embeddings\\nare an integral part of modern NLP systems, of-\\nfering signiﬁcant improvements over embeddings\\nlearned from scratch (Turian et al., 2010). To pre-\\ntrain word embedding vectors, left-to-right lan-\\nguage modeling objectives have been used (Mnih\\nand Hinton, 2009), as well as objectives to dis-\\ncriminate correct from incorrect words in left and\\nright context (Mikolov et al., 2013).These approaches have been generalized to\\ncoarser granularities, such as sentence embed-\\ndings (Kiros et al., 2015; Logeswaran and Lee,\\n2018) or paragraph embeddings (Le and Mikolov,\\n2014). To train sentence representations, prior\\nwork has used objectives to rank candidate next\\nsentences (Jernite et al., 2017; Logeswaran and\\nLee, 2018), left-to-right generation of next sen-\\ntence words given a representation of the previous\\nsentence (Kiros et al., 2015), or denoising auto-\\nencoder derived objectives (Hill et al., 2016).\\nELMo and its predecessor (Peters et al., 2017,\\n2018a) generalize traditional word embedding re-\\nsearch along a different dimension. They extract\\ncontext-sensitive features from a left-to-right and a\\nright-to-left language model. The contextual rep-\\nresentation of each token is the concatenation of\\nthe left-to-right and right-to-left representations.\\nWhen integrating contextual word embeddings\\nwith existing task-speciﬁc architectures, ELMo\\nadvances the state of the art for several major NLP\\nbenchmarks (Peters et al., 2018a) including ques-\\ntion answering (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), sentiment\\nanalysis (Socher et al., 2013), and named entity\\nrecognition (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder,\\n2003). Melamud et al. (2016) proposed learning\\ncontextual representations through a task to pre-\\ndict a single word from both left and right context\\nusing LSTMs. Similar to ELMo, their model is\\nfeature-based and not deeply bidirectional. Fedus\\net al. (2018) shows that the cloze task can be used\\nto improve the robustness of text generation mod-\\nels.\\n2.2 Unsupervised Fine-tuning Approaches\\nAs with the feature-based approaches, the ﬁrst\\nworks in this direction only pre-trained word em-\\nbedding parameters from unlabeled text (Col-\\nlobert and Weston, 2008).\\nMore recently, sentence or document encoders\\nwhich produce contextual token representations\\nhave been pre-trained from unlabeled text and\\nﬁne-tuned for a supervised downstream task (Dai\\nand Le, 2015; Howard and Ruder, 2018; Radford\\net al., 2018). The advantage of these approaches\\nis that few parameters need to be learned from\\nscratch. At least partly due to this advantage,\\nOpenAI GPT (Radford et al., 2018) achieved pre-\\nviously state-of-the-art results on many sentence-\\nlevel tasks from the GLUE benchmark (Wang\\net al., 2018a).

Apart from output layers, the same architec-\\ntures are used in both pre-training and ﬁne-tuning. The same pre-trained model parameters are used to initialize\\nmodels for different down-stream tasks. During ﬁne-tuning, all parameters are ﬁne-tuned. [CLS] is a special\\nsymbol added in front of every input example, and [SEP] is a special separator token (e.g. separating ques-\\ntions/answers).\\ning and auto-encoder objectives have been used\\nfor pre-training such models (Howard and Ruder,\\n2018; Radford et al., 2018; Dai and Le, 2015).\\n2.3 Transfer Learning from Supervised Data\\nThere has also been work showing effective trans-\\nfer from supervised tasks with large datasets, such\\nas natural language inference (Conneau et al.,\\n2017) and machine translation (McCann et al.,\\n2017). Computer vision research has also demon-\\nstrated the importance of transfer learning from\\nlarge pre-trained models, where an effective recipe\\nis to ﬁne-tune models pre-trained with Ima-\\ngeNet (Deng et al., 2009; Yosinski et al., 2014).\\n3 BERT\\nWe introduce BERT and its detailed implementa-\\ntion in this section. There are two steps in our\\nframework: pre-training and ﬁne-tuning . Dur-\\ning pre-training, the model is trained on unlabeled\\ndata over different pre-training tasks. For ﬁne-\\ntuning, the BERT model is ﬁrst initialized with\\nthe pre-trained parameters, and all of the param-\\neters are ﬁne-tuned using labeled data from the\\ndownstream tasks. Each downstream task has sep-\\narate ﬁne-tuned models, even though they are ini-\\ntialized with the same pre-trained parameters. The\\nquestion-answering example in Figure 1 will serve\\nas a running example for this section.\\nA distinctive feature of BERT is its uniﬁed ar-\\nchitecture across different tasks. There is mini-mal difference between the pre-trained architec-\\nture and the ﬁnal downstream architecture.\\nModel Architecture BERT’s model architec-\\nture is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer en-\\ncoder based on the original implementation de-\\nscribed in Vaswani et al.

A “sequence” refers to the in-\\nput token sequence to BERT, which may be a sin-\\ngle sentence or two sentences packed together.\\nWe use WordPiece embeddings (Wu et al.,\\n2016) with a 30,000 token vocabulary. The ﬁrst\\ntoken of every sequence is always a special clas-\\nsiﬁcation token ( [CLS] ). The ﬁnal hidden state\\ncorresponding to this token is used as the ag-\\ngregate sequence representation for classiﬁcation\\ntasks. Sentence pairs are packed together into a\\nsingle sequence. We differentiate the sentences in\\ntwo ways. First, we separate them with a special\\ntoken ( [SEP] ). Second, we add a learned embed-\\nding to every token indicating whether it belongs\\nto sentence Aor sentence B. As shown in Figure 1,\\nwe denote input embedding as E, the ﬁnal hidden\\nvector of the special [CLS] token asC∈RH,\\nand the ﬁnal hidden vector for the ithinput token\\nasTi∈RH.\\nFor a given token, its input representation is\\nconstructed by summing the corresponding token,\\nsegment, and position embeddings. A visualiza-\\ntion of this construction can be seen in Figure 2.\\n3.1 Pre-training BERT\\nUnlike Peters et al. (2018a) and Radford et al.\\n(2018), we do not use traditional left-to-right or\\nright-to-left language models to pre-train BERT.\\nInstead, we pre-train BERT using two unsuper-\\nvised tasks, described in this section. This step\\nis presented in the left part of Figure 1.\\nTask #1: Masked LM Intuitively, it is reason-\\nable to believe that a deep bidirectional model is\\nstrictly more powerful than either a left-to-right\\nmodel or the shallow concatenation of a left-to-\\nright and a right-to-left model. Unfortunately,\\nstandard conditional language models can only be\\ntrained left-to-right orright-to-left, since bidirec-\\ntional conditioning would allow each word to in-\\ndirectly “see itself”, and the model could trivially\\npredict the target word in a multi-layered context.\\nformer is often referred to as a “Transformer encoder” while\\nthe left-context-only version is referred to as a “Transformer\\ndecoder” since it can be used for text generation.In order to train a deep bidirectional representa-\\ntion, we simply mask some percentage of the input\\ntokens at random, and then predict those masked\\ntokens. We refer to this procedure as a “masked\\nLM” (MLM), although it is often referred to as a\\nCloze task in the literature (Taylor, 1953). In this\\ncase, the ﬁnal hidden vectors corresponding to the\\nmask tokens are fed into an output softmax over\\nthe vocabulary, as in a standard LM. In all of our\\nexperiments, we mask 15% of all WordPiece to-\\nkens in each sequence at random. In contrast to\\ndenoising auto-encoders (Vincent et al., 2008), we\\nonly predict the masked words rather than recon-\\nstructing the entire input.\\nAlthough this allows us to obtain a bidirec-\\ntional pre-trained model, a downside is that we\\nare creating a mismatch between pre-training and\\nﬁne-tuning, since the [MASK] token does not ap-\\npear during ﬁne-tuning. To mitigate this, we do\\nnot always replace “masked” words with the ac-\\ntual[MASK] token. The training data generator\\nchooses 15% of the token positions at random for\\nprediction. If the i-th token is chosen, we replace\\nthei-th token with (1) the [MASK] token 80% of\\nthe time (2) a random token 10% of the time (3)\\nthe unchanged i-th token 10% of the time. Then,\\nTiwill be used to predict the original token with\\ncross entropy loss. We compare variations of this\\nprocedure in Appendix C.2.\\nTask #2: Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)\\nMany important downstream tasks such as Ques-\\ntion Answering (QA) and Natural Language Infer-\\nence (NLI) are based on understanding the rela-\\ntionship between two sentences, which is not di-\\nrectly captured by language modeling. In order\\nto train a model that understands sentence rela-\\ntionships, we pre-train for a binarized next sen-\\ntence prediction task that can be trivially gener-\\nated from any monolingual corpus. Speciﬁcally,\\nwhen choosing the sentences AandBfor each pre-\\ntraining example, 50% of the time Bis the actual\\nnext sentence that follows A(labeled as IsNext ),\\nand 50% of the time it is a random sentence from\\nthe corpus (labeled as NotNext ). As we show\\nin Figure 1, Cis used for next sentence predic-\\ntion (NSP).5Despite its simplicity, we demon-\\nstrate in Section 5.1 that pre-training towards this\\ntask is very beneﬁcial to both QA and NLI.6\\n5The ﬁnal model achieves 97%-98% accuracy on NSP.\\n6The vector Cis not a meaningful sentence representation\\nwithout ﬁne-tuning, since it was trained with NSP.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The input embeddings are the sum of the token embeddings, the segmenta-\\ntion embeddings and the position embeddings.\\nThe NSP task is closely related to representation-\\nlearning objectives used in Jernite et al. (2017) and\\nLogeswaran and Lee (2018). However, in prior\\nwork, only sentence embeddings are transferred to\\ndown-stream tasks, where BERT transfers all pa-\\nrameters to initialize end-task model parameters.\\nPre-training data The pre-training procedure\\nlargely follows the existing literature on language\\nmodel pre-training. For the pre-training corpus we\\nuse the BooksCorpus (800M words) (Zhu et al.,\\n2015) and English Wikipedia (2,500M words).\\nFor Wikipedia we extract only the text passages\\nand ignore lists, tables, and headers. It is criti-\\ncal to use a document-level corpus rather than a\\nshufﬂed sentence-level corpus such as the Billion\\nWord Benchmark (Chelba et al., 2013) in order to\\nextract long contiguous sequences.\\n3.2 Fine-tuning BERT\\nFine-tuning is straightforward since the self-\\nattention mechanism in the Transformer al-\\nlows BERT to model many downstream tasks—\\nwhether they involve single text or text pairs—by\\nswapping out the appropriate inputs and outputs.\\nFor applications involving text pairs, a common\\npattern is to independently encode text pairs be-\\nfore applying bidirectional cross attention, such\\nas Parikh et al. (2016); Seo et al. (2017). BERT\\ninstead uses the self-attention mechanism to unify\\nthese two stages, as encoding a concatenated text\\npair with self-attention effectively includes bidi-\\nrectional cross attention between two sentences.\\nFor each task, we simply plug in the task-\\nspeciﬁc inputs and outputs into BERT and ﬁne-\\ntune all the parameters end-to-end. At the in-\\nput, sentence Aand sentence Bfrom pre-training\\nare analogous to (1) sentence pairs in paraphras-\\ning, (2) hypothesis-premise pairs in entailment, (3)\\nquestion-passage pairs in question answering, and(4) a degenerate text- ∅pair in text classiﬁcation\\nor sequence tagging. At the output, the token rep-\\nresentations are fed into an output layer for token-\\nlevel tasks, such as sequence tagging or question\\nanswering, and the [CLS] representation is fed\\ninto an output layer for classiﬁcation, such as en-\\ntailment or sentiment analysis.\\nCompared to pre-training, ﬁne-tuning is rela-\\ntively inexpensive. All of the results in the pa-\\nper can be replicated in at most 1 hour on a sin-\\ngle Cloud TPU, or a few hours on a GPU, starting\\nfrom the exact same pre-trained model.7We de-\\nscribe the task-speciﬁc details in the correspond-\\ning subsections of Section 4. More details can be\\nfound in Appendix A.5.\\n4 Experiments\\nIn this section, we present BERT ﬁne-tuning re-\\nsults on 11 NLP tasks.\\n4.1 GLUE\\nThe General Language Understanding Evaluation\\n(GLUE) benchmark (Wang et al., 2018a) is a col-\\nlection of diverse natural language understanding\\ntasks. Detailed descriptions of GLUE datasets are\\nincluded in Appendix B.1.\\nTo ﬁne-tune on GLUE, we represent the input\\nsequence (for single sentence or sentence pairs)\\nas described in Section 3, and use the ﬁnal hid-\\nden vectorC∈RHcorresponding to the ﬁrst\\ninput token ( [CLS] ) as the aggregate representa-\\ntion.

The left-only constraint\\nwas also applied at ﬁne-tuning, because removing\\nit introduced a pre-train/ﬁne-tune mismatch that\\ndegraded downstream performance. Additionally,\\nthis model was pre-trained without the NSP task.\\nThis is directly comparable to OpenAI GPT, but\\nusing our larger training dataset, our input repre-\\nsentation, and our ﬁne-tuning scheme.\\nWe ﬁrst examine the impact brought by the NSP\\ntask. In Table 5, we show that removing NSP\\nhurts performance signiﬁcantly on QNLI, MNLI,\\nand SQuAD 1.1. Next, we evaluate the impact\\nof training bidirectional representations by com-\\nparing “No NSP” to “LTR & No NSP”. The LTR\\nmodel performs worse than the MLM model on all\\ntasks, with large drops on MRPC and SQuAD.\\nFor SQuAD it is intuitively clear that a LTR\\nmodel will perform poorly at token predictions,\\nsince the token-level hidden states have no right-\\nside context. In order to make a good faith at-\\ntempt at strengthening the LTR system, we added\\na randomly initialized BiLSTM on top. This does\\nsigniﬁcantly improve results on SQuAD, but theresults are still far worse than those of the pre-\\ntrained bidirectional models. The BiLSTM hurts\\nperformance on the GLUE tasks.\\nWe recognize that it would also be possible to\\ntrain separate LTR and RTL models and represent\\neach token as the concatenation of the two mod-\\nels, as ELMo does. However: (a) this is twice as\\nexpensive as a single bidirectional model; (b) this\\nis non-intuitive for tasks like QA, since the RTL\\nmodel would not be able to condition the answer\\non the question; (c) this it is strictly less powerful\\nthan a deep bidirectional model, since it can use\\nboth left and right context at every layer.\\n5.2 Effect of Model Size\\nIn this section, we explore the effect of model size\\non ﬁne-tuning task accuracy. We trained a number\\nof BERT models with a differing number of layers,\\nhidden units, and attention heads, while otherwise\\nusing the same hyperparameters and training pro-\\ncedure as described previously.\\nResults on selected GLUE tasks are shown in\\nTable 6. In this table, we report the average Dev\\nSet accuracy from 5 random restarts of ﬁne-tuning.\\nWe can see that larger models lead to a strict ac-\\ncuracy improvement across all four datasets, even\\nfor MRPC which only has 3,600 labeled train-\\ning examples, and is substantially different from\\nthe pre-training tasks. It is also perhaps surpris-\\ning that we are able to achieve such signiﬁcant\\nimprovements on top of models which are al-\\nready quite large relative to the existing literature.\\nFor example, the largest Transformer explored in\\nVaswani et al. (2017) is (L=6, H=1024, A=16)\\nwith 100M parameters for the encoder, and the\\nlargest Transformer we have found in the literature\\nis (L=64, H=512, A=2) with 235M parameters\\n(Al-Rfou et al., 2018). By contrast, BERT BASE\\ncontains 110M parameters and BERT LARGE con-\\ntains 340M parameters.\\nIt has long been known that increasing the\\nmodel size will lead to continual improvements\\non large-scale tasks such as machine translation\\nand language modeling, which is demonstrated\\nby the LM perplexity of held-out training data\\nshown in Table 6. However, we believe that\\nthis is the ﬁrst work to demonstrate convinc-\\ningly that scaling to extreme model sizes also\\nleads to large improvements on very small scale\\ntasks, provided that the model has been sufﬁ-\\nciently pre-trained.

(2016) men-\\ntioned in passing that increasing hidden dimen-\\nsion size from 200 to 600 helped, but increasing\\nfurther to 1,000 did not bring further improve-\\nments. Both of these prior works used a feature-\\nbased approach — we hypothesize that when the\\nmodel is ﬁne-tuned directly on the downstream\\ntasks and uses only a very small number of ran-\\ndomly initialized additional parameters, the task-\\nspeciﬁc models can beneﬁt from the larger, more\\nexpressive pre-trained representations even when\\ndownstream task data is very small.\\n5.3 Feature-based Approach with BERT\\nAll of the BERT results presented so far have used\\nthe ﬁne-tuning approach, where a simple classiﬁ-\\ncation layer is added to the pre-trained model, and\\nall parameters are jointly ﬁne-tuned on a down-\\nstream task. However, the feature-based approach,\\nwhere ﬁxed features are extracted from the pre-\\ntrained model, has certain advantages. First, not\\nall tasks can be easily represented by a Trans-\\nformer encoder architecture, and therefore require\\na task-speciﬁc model architecture to be added.\\nSecond, there are major computational beneﬁts\\nto pre-compute an expensive representation of the\\ntraining data once and then run many experiments\\nwith cheaper models on top of this representation.\\nIn this section, we compare the two approaches\\nby applying BERT to the CoNLL-2003 Named\\nEntity Recognition (NER) task (Tjong Kim Sang\\nand De Meulder, 2003). In the input to BERT, we\\nuse a case-preserving WordPiece model, and we\\ninclude the maximal document context provided\\nby the data.

We use the representation of\\nthe ﬁrst sub-token as the input to the token-level\\nclassiﬁer over the NER label set.\\nTo ablate the ﬁne-tuning approach, we apply the\\nfeature-based approach by extracting the activa-\\ntions from one or more layers without ﬁne-tuning\\nany parameters of BERT.

In\\nparticular, these results enable even low-resource\\ntasks to beneﬁt from deep unidirectional architec-\\ntures. Our major contribution is further general-\\nizing these ﬁndings to deep bidirectional architec-\\ntures, allowing the same pre-trained model to suc-\\ncessfully tackle a broad set of NLP tasks.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The purpose of this is to bias the\\nrepresentation towards the actual observed\\nword.\\nThe advantage of this procedure is that the\\nTransformer encoder does not know which words\\nit will be asked to predict or which have been re-\\nplaced by random words, so it is forced to keep\\na distributional contextual representation of ev-\\neryinput token. Additionally, because random\\nreplacement only occurs for 1.5% of all tokens\\n(i.e., 10% of 15%), this does not seem to harm\\nthe model’s language understanding capability.

We\\nuse Adam with learning rate of 1e-4, β1= 0.9,\\nβ2= 0.999, L2 weight decay of 0.01, learning\\nrate warmup over the ﬁrst 10,000 steps, and linear\\ndecay of the learning rate. We use a dropout prob-\\nability of 0.1 on all layers. We use a gelu acti-\\nvation (Hendrycks and Gimpel, 2016) rather than\\nthe standard relu , following OpenAI GPT. The\\ntraining loss is the sum of the mean masked LM\\nlikelihood and the mean next sentence prediction\\nlikelihood.\\nTraining of BERT BASE was performed on 4\\nCloud TPUs in Pod conﬁguration (16 TPU chips\\ntotal).13Training of BERT LARGE was performed\\non 16 Cloud TPUs (64 TPU chips total). Each pre-\\ntraining took 4 days to complete.\\nLonger sequences are disproportionately expen-\\nsive because attention is quadratic to the sequence\\nlength. To speed up pretraing in our experiments,\\nwe pre-train the model with sequence length of\\n128 for 90% of the steps. Then, we train the rest\\n10% of the steps of sequence of 512 to learn the\\npositional embeddings.\\nA.3 Fine-tuning Procedure\\nFor ﬁne-tuning, most model hyperparameters are\\nthe same as in pre-training, with the exception of\\nthe batch size, learning rate, and number of train-\\ning epochs. The dropout probability was always\\nkept at 0.1. The optimal hyperparameter values\\nare task-speciﬁc, but we found the following range\\nof possible values to work well across all tasks:\\n•Batch size : 16, 32\\n13https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2018/06/Cloud-\\nTPU-now-offers-preemptible-pricing-and-global-\\navailability.html', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The comparisons be-\\ntween the model architectures are shown visually\\nin Figure 3. Note that in addition to the architec-\\nture differences, BERT and OpenAI GPT are ﬁne-\\ntuning approaches, while ELMo is a feature-based\\napproach.\\nThe most comparable existing pre-training\\nmethod to BERT is OpenAI GPT, which trains a\\nleft-to-right Transformer LM on a large text cor-\\npus. In fact, many of the design decisions in BERT\\nwere intentionally made to make it as close to\\nGPT as possible so that the two methods could be\\nminimally compared. The core argument of this\\nwork is that the bi-directionality and the two pre-\\ntraining tasks presented in Section 3.1 account for\\nthe majority of the empirical improvements, but\\nwe do note that there are several other differences\\nbetween how BERT and GPT were trained:\\n• GPT is trained on the BooksCorpus (800M\\nwords); BERT is trained on the BooksCor-\\npus (800M words) and Wikipedia (2,500M\\nwords).\\n• GPT uses a sentence separator ( [SEP] ) and\\nclassiﬁer token ( [CLS] ) which are only in-\\ntroduced at ﬁne-tuning time; BERT learns\\n[SEP] ,[CLS] and sentence A/Bembed-\\ndings during pre-training.\\n• GPT was trained for 1M steps with a batch\\nsize of 32,000 words; BERT was trained for\\n1M steps with a batch size of 128,000 words.\\n• GPT used the same learning rate of 5e-5 for\\nall ﬁne-tuning experiments; BERT chooses a\\ntask-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning learning rate which\\nperforms the best on the development set.To isolate the effect of these differences, we per-\\nform ablation experiments in Section 5.1 which\\ndemonstrate that the majority of the improvements\\nare in fact coming from the two pre-training tasks\\nand the bidirectionality they enable.\\nA.5 Illustrations of Fine-tuning on Different\\nTasks\\nThe illustration of ﬁne-tuning BERT on different\\ntasks can be seen in Figure 4. Our task-speciﬁc\\nmodels are formed by incorporating BERT with\\none additional output layer, so a minimal num-\\nber of parameters need to be learned from scratch.\\nAmong the tasks, (a) and (b) are sequence-level\\ntasks while (c) and (d) are token-level tasks.

Question: Does BERT really need such\\na large amount of pre-training (128,000\\nwords/batch * 1,000,000 steps) to achieve\\nhigh ﬁne-tuning accuracy?\\nAnswer: Yes, BERT BASE achieves almost\\n1.0% additional accuracy on MNLI when\\ntrained on 1M steps compared to 500k steps.\\n2. Question: Does MLM pre-training converge\\nslower than LTR pre-training, since only 15%\\nof words are predicted in each batch rather\\nthan every word?\\nAnswer: The MLM model does converge\\nslightly slower than the LTR model. How-\\never, in terms of absolute accuracy the MLM\\nmodel begins to outperform the LTR model\\nalmost immediately.\\nC.2 Ablation for Different Masking\\nProcedures\\nIn Section 3.1, we mention that BERT uses a\\nmixed strategy for masking the target tokens when\\npre-training with the masked language model\\n(MLM) objective. The following is an ablation\\nstudy to evaluate the effect of different masking\\nstrategies.\\n200 400 600 800 1,0007678808284\\nPre-training Steps (Thousands)MNLI Dev Accuracy\\nBERT BASE (Masked LM)\\nBERT BASE (Left-to-Right)\\nFigure 5: Ablation over number of training steps.

The x-axis is the value of k.Note that the purpose of the masking strategies\\nis to reduce the mismatch between pre-training\\nand ﬁne-tuning, as the [MASK] symbol never ap-\\npears during the ﬁne-tuning stage. We report the\\nDev results for both MNLI and NER. For NER,\\nwe report both ﬁne-tuning and feature-based ap-\\nproaches, as we expect the mismatch will be am-\\npliﬁed for the feature-based approach as the model\\nwill not have the chance to adjust the representa-\\ntions.\\nMasking Rates Dev Set Results\\nMASK SAME RND MNLI NER\\nFine-tune Fine-tune Feature-based\\n80% 10% 10% 84.2 95.4 94.9\\n100% 0% 0% 84.3 94.9 94.0\\n80% 0% 20% 84.1 95.2 94.6\\n80% 20% 0% 84.4 95.2 94.7\\n0% 20% 80% 83.7 94.8 94.6\\n0% 0% 100% 83.6 94.9 94.6\\nTable 8: Ablation over different masking strategies.\\nThe results are presented in Table 8.
